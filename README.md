# purchases

Track prices in different stores.

## Getting Started

This is an Android/iOS app (take note that it was tested only on Android) for optimizing
purchases in local stores.

Generate Google Maps API key and store `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...` in two places:
- `.env`
- `android/local.properties`

For bugs see [TODO](TODO.md) and `TODO`/`FIXME` in the source.
